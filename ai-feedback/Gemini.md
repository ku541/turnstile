**Excellent Work!**

Your `turnstile.js` and `turnstile.test.js` files are well-structured, clear, and effectively demonstrate the functionality of the Turnstile class. The test cases are comprehensive, covering various scenarios and edge cases. 

Here are some additional observations and potential improvements:

**Code Clarity and Maintainability:**

* **Clear Naming:** Your variable and function names are descriptive and easy to understand.
* **Concise Logic:** The code is well-organized and avoids unnecessary complexity.
* **Comments:** While the code is self-explanatory, adding comments for complex logic or non-obvious decisions can further enhance readability.

**Test Case Coverage:**

* **Edge Case Testing:** Consider adding more test cases to cover potential edge cases, such as:
  - Multiple consecutive coin insertions without passing.
  - Multiple consecutive passes without coin insertions.
  - A mix of coin insertions and passes in various sequences.
* **Error Handling:** While the current implementation doesn't explicitly handle errors, you could consider adding tests to ensure the class behaves correctly in unexpected situations (e.g., negative coin values).

**Potential Optimization:**

* **State Management:** The current implementation uses multiple state variables. You might explore using a single state variable to represent the turnstile's state (e.g., locked, unlocked, alarmed). This could simplify the logic and reduce the number of state transitions.

**Overall:**

Your code and tests are impressive. By addressing the suggestions above, you can further strengthen the robustness and maintainability of your implementation. Keep up the great work!
