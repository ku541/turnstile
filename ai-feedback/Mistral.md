Your implementation and tests for the `Turnstile` class look solid. The tests cover a variety of scenarios, ensuring that the turnstile behaves correctly under different conditions. Here are a few observations and suggestions:

### Observations:
1. **Initial State**: The turnstile starts locked, silent, and coinless, which is correctly verified by the first test.
2. **Coin Handling**: The turnstile correctly increments the coin count and unlocks when a coin is inserted.
3. **Passing Through**: The turnstile locks again after someone passes through, and it correctly handles the alarm state based on whether a coin was inserted.
4. **Refunds**: The turnstile correctly refunds coins if a coin is inserted while it is already unlocked.
5. **Alarm State**: The turnstile correctly sets the alarm if someone tries to pass without inserting a coin and resets the alarm when a coin is inserted afterward.
6. **Consecutive Passes**: The turnstile handles consecutive passes correctly, maintaining the coin count and refunds appropriately.

### Suggestions:
1. **Code Documentation**: Consider adding comments or documentation to your `Turnstile` class methods to explain their purpose and behavior. This will make the code more maintainable and understandable for others.
2. **Edge Cases**: While your tests cover a good range of scenarios, you might want to consider additional edge cases, such as:
   - Inserting multiple coins before passing through.
   - Trying to pass through multiple times without inserting a coin.
   - Inserting a coin after the alarm has been triggered and then passing through.
3. **Test Naming**: The test names are descriptive, but you could make them even more explicit by including the expected behavior in the name. For example:
   - `test('increases balance after coin')` could be `test('should increase coin count and unlock after inserting a coin')`.
4. **Error Handling**: Consider adding error handling or validation to ensure that the methods are used correctly. For example, you might want to throw an error if someone tries to pass through while the turnstile is unlocked without inserting a coin.
5. **Coverage Report**: The coverage report shows 100% coverage, which is excellent. However, ensure that your tests are not just covering lines of code but also covering all possible behaviors and edge cases.

### Example of Enhanced Test Naming:
```javascript
test('should be locked, silent, and coinless initially', () => {
    const turnstile = new Turnstile;

    assert.strictEqual(turnstile.isLocked, true);
    assert.strictEqual(turnstile.isAlarming, false);
    assert.strictEqual(turnstile.coins, 0);
    assert.strictEqual(turnstile.refunds, 0);
});

test('should increase coin count and unlock after inserting a coin', () => {
    const turnstile = new Turnstile;

    turnstile.handleCoin();

    assert.strictEqual(turnstile.isLocked, false);
    assert.strictEqual(turnstile.isAlarming, false);
    assert.strictEqual(turnstile.coins, 1);
    assert.strictEqual(turnstile.refunds, 0);
});

// Similar enhancements for other tests
```

Overall, your implementation and tests are well-done. Keep up the good work!
