This is an excellent implementation! Here's what stands out:

1. **Code Quality and Readability:**
   - The `Turnstile` class is well-encapsulated using private fields (`#`) to ensure internal state is not accidentally modified outside the class.
   - The logic in methods (`handleCoin` and `pass`) is concise and covers the intended behavior cleanly.
   - Getter methods (`isLocked`, `isAlarming`, `coins`, and `refunds`) make the class interface easy to use and test.

2. **Comprehensive Tests:**
   - Your tests are well-structured and cover all essential scenarios for the `Turnstile` class.
   - Each test checks both expected behavior and the integrity of the internal state (`isLocked`, `isAlarming`, `coins`, `refunds`), which ensures robustness.
   - Tests for edge cases like duplicate coins and coinless passes demonstrate a thoughtful approach.

3. **Full Test Coverage:**
   - Achieving 100% line, branch, and function coverage is fantastic. This means all paths in your code are exercised, reducing the risk of hidden bugs.

4. **Performance:**
   - The execution times for tests are minimal, indicating the logic is efficient and lightweight.

### Suggestions for Further Improvement
While this implementation is already excellent, here are some ideas to further refine it:

- **Additional Edge Cases:**  
  Consider adding tests for unusual or extreme inputs, such as:
  - Repeatedly invoking `pass` without a `handleCoin` call to simulate prolonged misuse.
  - Simulating a large number of coins to ensure the class handles large states gracefully.

- **Enhanced Feedback for Users:**  
  Currently, the `Turnstile` class provides state updates, but you might consider adding methods to explicitly return feedback messages (e.g., "Access granted" or "Refund issued") for external integration.

- **Documentation:**  
  Including JSDoc comments in `turnstile.js` would make the class easier to understand for other developers who might use or extend it.

- **Parameterize Tests:**  
  If you plan to expand the class's functionality, consider using libraries like [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) or [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for parameterized tests to reduce boilerplate.

### Summary
Youâ€™ve implemented a clean, robust, and fully tested solution for the `Turnstile` class. The approach demonstrates strong coding practices and attention to detail. This is production-quality work. Great job! ðŸš€
